(sound of balls being hit) I'll tell you why later. (sound of restraints being put on) That's going to be good. (laughs) Too good. Jesus. That was good. It was a good backhand as well. (sighs) (grunting) ( sound of foot steps) Yes! No, clearly not. Clearly not a hindrance. Oh my God. I just fell over. This guy's so... This guy's so shitty, he lost. Ah, it's the sunglasses. Okay. Let's go. It's so hot. Oh, I forgot there's some weight. (grunting) (sound of ball being hit) Slice. (breathing heavily) Ah! Out! (pauses for breath) Okay. Can't wait to have my master's service. Oh my God. The service is popping off today. You can be up there if you want. For fucks sake, man. It's so hot now. Sergio, I don't know why I'm even. Let's go to that side and out of here. Come on. I'm going man. Okay, let's go. Sergio hit it that way. (grunts) Holy moly, guaca-Choley. Fuck me, what was that? What kind of return is that? He hit that like a mile long. Fuck, you're not playing baseball. Okay, next ball. Let's go, let's go. Let's go. (groans) Oh my God, what a return! Holy... Oh, Sergio is right now stunned with how good that return was. Bro, it's not the racket, man. It's not the racket, Sergio. It's not the racket. It's you. I'll go get an adrian though. Yeah, sure, sure. Come on. (ball being smacked) (grunts) Oh my God, so good. Okay, let's go. (grunts) (sound of ball being hit) Yay! Great shot. Great shot. Oh my God. I doubt I'm going to hit that in this party. Okay. (grunts) Oh, thank God. Okay, get this serve in. (groans) Ah, what is that? Type of block on this side and it's so... Wait, where's that earlier bite? Down there, like no. I would have thought that was early. Is that his second ball?(Footsteps thumping) (breathing heavily) Uh. (key chain jangling) It's a really bad ball. Eh, Ma? Only new balls is good. (breathing heavily) Uh. (ball thudding) Uh. (breathing heavily) Ah. What? Okay. (gasps) I keep forgetting I'm wearing a mic. Oh, it's 'cause my cat was so jealous. This thing, you're a bitch. You can't play tennis. Uh. Oh, I lagged. (breathing heavily) Uh. Uh. Uh. Unbelievable. She can cut through. What's that score? Easy. Yeah. (breathing heavily) Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Oh, no. One, tie you. It's an easy pick up twice. You got that. Make that. Make that. You need to make that. Okay. (breathing heavily) Ah. Make this set. Ah. Ah. Great block out. (breathing heavily) Great block out there. (breathing heavily) Hit that wide. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, you can't miss that. (breathing heavily) You can't miss those. Make that. Make that. Four-ounce... It's a volley ball. Hey. Linus, Linus Jaskin. Hi. We playing set? Yes, let's press it. Set? All right. Very important. Every thought that comes, you say out loud, okay? I was calling you a bitch with my head. Good. No, but you have to say it. Say it. Good. Yeah. Everything. Really, that's all. Otherwise it doesn't work. I was talking the whole time. You were? Did you call me a bitch? Yeah. (laughs) On there? (laughs) Yeah. Because of my grass lies, you mean? Yeah. 'Cause you are fucking piece of shit to me. It's all good though. All right. He serves. Spin it? Want a spin? Uh, up or down? Down? All right. (breathing heavily) All right, up. Um, I'll serve. (breathing heavily)
